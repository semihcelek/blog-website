Why do we need instructional objectives?</h2>\n<p>Learning and teaching are essential proccess that are linked tightly together in respect of knowledge, values, skills, and behaviors. Teaching is about imprating knowledge whereas learing involves acquiring knowledge. Assessment on education mainly focuses evaluating or measuring the learing process and learing outcomes of students on teaching subject.</p>\n<p>Instructional objectives plays important role, when educator design their learning material, it guides both teacher and students on shared learning goals. Also instructional objectives clarifies the intended learing outcomes and it provides a base for both teaching and assessment. Instructional objectives also helpful when educator is evaluating students performance on a subject and it helps to assess students learing accomplishments. Teacher can easily make assessment based on instructional objects. Without the instructional objects, it isn't possible to accomplish a well-constructed lecture or coures, and also it isn't possible to make thoughtful assessements on subject. So it is highly important concept that should be implemented on education plans.</p>\n<p>In order to create convenient instructional objectives, educators should state \"intended learning outcomes\", and educator should create a goals of instruction that should be measureable and observable in terms of student performance.</p>\n<!-- Having clearly identified objectives in learning enviroments has great importance.\n\nLearing objectives has direct affect on learing outcomes, with properly identified and planned objectives, the effectiveness of education can can be increased dramatically.\n\nObjectives on learing envoriment, guides educator and students on learing content/material and helps to keep track the learning progress.\n\nto guide and keep track the learing progress -->\n<!-- state the specific Learing outcome, teach the specific task, test the specific task\n\nstate instructional objectives as \"intended outcome\" -->\n<h2>Example of Instructional Objectives</h2>\n<p>Learing Objectives: By the end of the course, students will be able to; </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>understand</strong> the fundemental paradigms of computer programming</li>\n<li><strong>develop</strong> computer applications that can solve real-life problems</li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"objectives-on-education"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2458793903","3255264069"]}
