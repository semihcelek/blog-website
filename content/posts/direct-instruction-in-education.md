## What knowledge or skills will you be teaching that could be used successfully in a direct instruction lesson? Why do you think this knowledge or skills fit into the direct instruction model?

Direct Instruction Model is education model that teacher primarily delivers learning experince. In a lecture, teacher is the center of information. In addition, the purpose of lectures is to guide learning group with well-developed and carefully planned learning materials.

In my opinion, teaching programming is an indeed nice fit to teach with Direct Instructional Model. Let me explain, programming is fundementaly mimicing real-life, essentially what we do with computers are very much alike with what we do in real-life, in other words students can easily transform ideas from previous daily life instances or previous lessons. For example, the use of functions in mathematics is quite identical to functions in programming, so students can easily reestablish new knowledge with using their previous mathematic and real-life knowledge so it is highly manageable to implement this methodology on programming lectures. On the other hand, programming lectures mainly relys on knowledge or capabilities of the instructure, so in order to achive well-produced, thoughfull lecture, educators should take account the level of students and should set instructional objectives that can be achievable. Also performing this programming lectures with Direct Instructional model enables educators to be flexible on learning procedure. For example, the learning metarials and objectives can be set respecting to students academic level, or if it possible, computers or visual technologies can be used for demonstration or practise purposes for increasing the efficiency in lectures, or Guided practices can be used for teaching the coding paragims, allowing students to make guess or identify with their prior real-life experience and knowledge can be example implementation for Direct Instructional Model in computer programming lectures.
