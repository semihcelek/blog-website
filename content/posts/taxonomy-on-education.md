### 1. How can you determine whether comprehension-type questions are appropriate to your students’ grade or developmental level? 

### 2. Give an example of an application problem from your own field of study.

### 3. The last three items in the cognitive taxonomy—analysis, synthesis, and evaluation—are often called “higher-order skills.” What makes them “higher-order“? 

### 4.  Of all the skills listed in Bloom’s taxonomy, which have you been most successful using in your own schooling? Which have come most naturally to you? Which are more challenging?  


Instructional objectives plays important role, when instructures creates learning material. Stating instructional objects guides educator on learing metarial and helps both on creating materials, and making assessment on subject. When determening the students developmental state, it's highly important to differentiate the learning stages in terms of knowledge, comprehension, and application. When educator determines the comprehension-type and plans assessment base on that, the assessments needs to measure the comprehension level of students. For example, in programming lecture students needs to; **explain** the key points of the software development, **identify** the important pradigms of computer programming, and **recognize** the programming process. These assessments can be done in different kinds of methods, exams, projects, and writing-assignments might be example. In contrast, in order to identify the developmental level equitably/thoughtfuly and grading accurately, the learing objects and comprehension-types should correlate.

I am realy intersted in computer programming and I am trying to develop applications that mimicking real-life, so if I were to give a lecture or course on programming, I 

The important fact that makes taxonomy analysis, synthesis, and evaluation "high-order" is these cognitive skills are requiring the low order skills to function and exist. It not will be possible to exist these high-order skills without knowledge, comprehension, application skills. High order skills has important role on lecturces but, in order to benefit this role, student should have been acquired the low-order skills, otherwise it might not be that helpful.

In my experience, the most natural implementation of Bloom's taxanomy, is application skills, I have been developing web aplication for about a year and I learn most of the technologies and coding skills via constructing projects,applying methodologies. By doing projects with my own hand helped me to learn much more effectively. When I learn about new technologies I make litte reading and information gathering about the new technology and I immediately use such new technology and construct new applications with it. Also construction applications upon new learned material, makes knowledge long-lasting. I think that application skill is the most affective learning taxonomy on my understaning. On the other hand, I think that making analysis is the most challenging one, because it is a higher-order skill that requires decent understanding on subject. I think that analyzing and making comparison are undoubtedly intimidating, for example, when i develop a feature on application, the analysis side is testing, and in order to analyze the application, i must write a test subject that analyzes both user behavior and the apps implementation, so analysis skill is definitely hard one for me.
